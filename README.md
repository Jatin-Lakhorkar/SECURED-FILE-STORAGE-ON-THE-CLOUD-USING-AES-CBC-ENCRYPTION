This project implements a double-stage encryption algorithm that provides high security, scalability, confidentiality, and easy accessibility of multimedia content in the cloud. The system uses two different hybrid approaches for encryption and decryption, namely AES and RSA algorithms, and AES and Blowfish algorithms, and shows a comparative study on the difference between the two approaches [1]. The main goal is to securely store and access data in the cloud that is not controlled by the owner of the data. In this paper an approach is used that ensures the security and privacy of client-sensitive information by storing data across a single cloud, using AES, DES, and RC2 algorithms [2].
